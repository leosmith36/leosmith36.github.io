      <p>
        I am from West Fargo, North Dakota. In May 2023, I graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts
        in mathematics and chemistry. Now, I am working as a software developer at Voxtelesys in Fargo, North Dakota, where I develop code to
        maintain and improve the company's HUD and customer portal, among many other duties.

        I consider myself an analytical person, and I find enjoyment in leveraging my skills in logic and problem-solving to solve challenging problems 
        in rigorous projects. Outside of my career and educational involvements, I am a dedicated long-distance runner, and I enjoy reading books,
        engaging in personal coding projects, and independently studying a diverse array of subjects. As such, the main purposes of this website
        are to document my personal projects, share and reflect on my endeavors, and provide information about my academic and professional background.

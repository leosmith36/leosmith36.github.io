    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am from West Fargo, North Dakota, and I recently graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts
      in mathematics and chemistry. Now, I am working as a software developer at Voxtelesys in Fargo, North Dakota, where I produce code to
      maintain and improve the company's HUD and customer portal, among many other duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a very analytical mind, and I find enjoyment in utilizing my skills in logic and problem-solving to address challenging
      issues alongside motivated teammates. Whether it is a mathematical proof or a computer algorithm, I find great satisfaction in developing
      simple and elegant solutions to problems with both practical and theoretical applications. Likewise, my goal for the near future is to continue
      growing my skills in computer science through online, part-time graduate studies while working as a full-time software developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of my career and educational involvements, I am a dedicated long-distance runner, and I enjoy reading books, engaging in personal
      coding projects, and independently studying a diverse array of subjects. As such, the main purposes of this website are to document my personal
      projects, track my progress in reading and learning, and provide a place for reflection as I progress through my career.

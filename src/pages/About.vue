    <h1 class="header">About Me</h1>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>
        I have always had a thirst for challenges. Whether it is designing complex software applications, 
        learning new technologies, writing mathematical proofs, or running marathons, I enjoy the thrill of doing difficult things.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why, after graduating Summa Cum Laude from Concordia College in Moorhead, MN with degrees in mathematics and chemistry, 
        I decided to pursue a career in software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software engineering combines everything I love most: complex logic, teamwork, problem-solving, and cutting-edge technology.
        I have worked with a plethora of programming languages, frameworks, and databases, with the notable ones being Node.js, Golang,
        Vue.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and Python. More recently, I have placed emphasis on improving my skills in system design, requirements gathering,
        and the development of robust testing frameworks. As I continue to grow as a software engineer, my hope is to not only continue to learnin 
        new languages and technologies to implement into my work, but also work towards mastery over the process of creating robust, scalable, and
        maintainable software from the ground up.

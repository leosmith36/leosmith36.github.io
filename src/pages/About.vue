      <p>
        I am from West Fargo, North Dakota. In May 2023, I graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts
        in mathematics and chemistry. Now, I am working as a software developer at Voxtelesys in Fargo, North Dakota, where I develop code to
        maintain and improve the company's customer portal, support HUD, and various web services.

        I consider myself an analytical person, and I find enjoyment in leveraging my skills in logic and problem-solving to solve challenging problems 
        in rigorous projects. I am constantly striving to expand my skillset by learning new technologies and improving my workflow. 
        Outside of my career and educational involvements, I am a dedicated long-distance runner, and I enjoy reading books,
        engaging in personal coding projects, and independently studying a diverse array of subjects. Likewise, the main purposes of this website
        are to document my personal projects, reflect on my endeavors, and provide information about my academic and professional background.

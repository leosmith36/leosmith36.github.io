      <p>
        I am from West Fargo, North Dakota. In May 2023, I graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts
        in mathematics and chemistry. Now, I am working as a software engineer at Voxtelesys in Fargo, North Dakota, where I develop code to
        maintain and improve the company's customer portal, support HUD, billing web services, and voice applications.

        As a mathematics major, I find enjoyment in devising elegant solutions to complex problems that require approaching a solution from
        multiple angles. Software engineering is thus a great fit for my skills as it provides me the ability to work on challenging projects
        that involve complex logic and analytical thinking.

        In my free time, I am a dedicated long-distance runner who striving to one day quality for the Olympic trials in the marathon.

        I am from West Fargo, ND. In May 2023, I graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, MN with a Bachelor of Arts
        in mathematics and chemistry. Now, I am working as a software engineer at Voxtelesys in Fargo, ND, where I develop code to
        maintain and improve the company's customer portal, support HUD, billing web services, and voice applications.
